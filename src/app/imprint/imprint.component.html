    <p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
    <h3>Note on the responsible body</h3>

    <p>Peter Steinlesberger<br />
        San Blas<br />
        Obligado<br />
        Paraguay</p>

    <p>Telefon: +49 (0) 123 44 55 66<br />

    <p>Unless a specific storage period has been specified in this data protection declaration, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons have ceased to exist.</p>
    <h3>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</h3>
    <p>If you have consented to the data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a GDPR or Article 9 Paragraph 2 Letter a GDPR, if special data categories according to Article 9 Paragraph 1 GDPR are processed. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Article 49 (1) (a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on Section 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required to fulfill the contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR.

    <h3>Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</h3>
    <p>Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data can be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that in these countries no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as the person concerned being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. secret services) will process, evaluate and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing that took place up until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

    <h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>

        <li>Wenn die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten unrechtm&auml;&szlig;ig geschah/geschieht, k&ouml;nnen
