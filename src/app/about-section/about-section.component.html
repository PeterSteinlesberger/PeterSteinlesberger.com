        <p data-aos-delay="250" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">If you are looking for a highly motivated and reliable Junior Front End Developer, who is eager to learn and has a lot of life experience, then this is the right place.</p>
        <p data-aos-delay="300" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">My name is Peter Steinlesberger, I am a native Austrian and 45 years old.</p>
        <p data-aos-delay="350" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">I love life with all its great challenges and enjoy the little free time I have with my family of six to the fullest.</p>
        <p data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">Since 2003 I am regularly drawn to distant countries. Between 2007 and 2010 I used the time abroad to play poker professionally and also to live as a digital nomad. In 2012 I met my true love, my wife, who brought me to Germany. Last year we decided to leave Germany and to live as digital nomads. Currently, we are living in Paraguay and are planning our next travel destination.</p>

            <p data-aos-delay="250" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">Up till now, I have gained a lot of work experience in a variety of jobs and professions - as a carpenter, croupier, flooring technician, service technician and a handyman all-rounder. I also started two retail businesses and was able to learn a lot in the process. </p>
            <p data-aos-delay="300" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">You're probably wondering why I decided once again to undergo extensive training as a Front End Developer at the Developer Akademie in Munich, Germany.</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="350" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">Well, I love to take in a lot of intellectual input and "process" about it (as my wife lovingly puts it). I love to reflect on problems and find solutions and also to search outside the box. In my former jobs, these needs were satisfied only to a limited extent. Therefore, for the last twenty-five years I have been self-contained studying different sciences like economics, financial markets, etc.</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">In 2006, I successfully completed extensive training in C, C++ and software engineering at the Economic Development Institute of Austria. However, at that time my online poker career quickly gained momentum, so I finally decided to pursue this profession. In 2010, I ended my career as a poker pro and went back to working in my previous jobs for the sake of my family.</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="450" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">And here we come full the circle to the above-mentioned question: Why then again begin a demanding education as a programmer?!</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">Because this profession fulfills at least four of my preferences:</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="550" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">1. Programming - a never-ending story of input</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="600" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">2. I have to solve problems by logical processes </p>
            <p data-aos-delay="650" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">3. Achieving goals together as a team</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="700" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">4. Designing webapps gives me the opportunity to use my creative potential as welll</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="750" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">...and it allows my family and me to be geographically independent. </p>
            <p data-aos-delay="800" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">At this point, according to the "script", I should provide hard evidence of my skills. Sure, I could offer many professional degrees and certificates wrapped in a nice slider (for the certificates feel free to visit my LinkedIn profile). But that does not represent a skilled programmer.</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="850" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">It is much more important that you know how to program, that you are willing to keep learning, that you can integrate well into the existing team and that you can add value to the company in the long run. </p>
            <p data-aos-delay="900" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up"> I would like to give you a taste of the former with this webapp and the linked projects.</p>
            <p data-aos-delay="950" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos="flip-up">However, it is certainly best for you and me to invite me to an interview followed by a trial code project. This is the fastest and best way to find out if I am the person you are looking for.</p>
